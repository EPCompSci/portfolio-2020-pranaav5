2020-2021 Portfolio

## About me
I am Pranaav Srinivasan, and this is my github portfolio. I first started learning code in 9th grade, in AP Computer Science Principles, in APCSP I used MIT App inventor and made apps and games with blocks of code. The year after, In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in that class I learned java. Now I am in 11th grade, a junior, and I am in iOS App Development. In iOS App Development, I learn and use Swift to make iOS apps, learning the basics of swift wasnt very difficult because I've already learned java. I have made art for games using photoshop and google draw too.

Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!
