## About me
I am Pranaav Srinivasan, and this is my github portfolio. I first started learning code in 9th grade, in AP Computer Science Principles, in APCSP I used MIT App inventor and made apps and games with blocks of code. The year after, In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in that class I learned java. Now I am in 11th grade, a junior, and I am in iOS App Development. In iOS App Development, I learn and use Swift to make iOS apps, learning the basics of Swift wasnt very difficult because I've already learned java. I have made art for games using photoshop and google draw too.

## iOS Projects
###### [Clicker Game](https://github.com/sarthyparty/clicker_game)
This game is a pretty simple game, you click a button that makes money and with enough money you can upgrade the button so it makes more money. Clicker game was the first actual game I worked on in Swift.

###### [Dodge](https://github.com/sarthyparty/dodge)
In Dodge, this game was a little harder to make, but basically there are spiked balls falling from the sky and you have to dodge the spiked balls by moving left to right, hence the name Dodge. 

###### [Infection Tag](https://github.com/sarthyparty/Infection-Tag)
This game is the hardest game me or my team members have worked on in Swift. This game is a 2d multiplayer game made with SpriteKit and its like tag but you get infected if your player gets touched. The non-infected have to stay alive to win or the Infected should infect everyone to win.
